# Edinburgh Airbnbs

## Introduction

**This is a work in progress.**

The aim of this project is to use InsideAirbnb's datasets on Edinburgh Airbnbs 2019 - 2021 to answer a range of questions. At the end of the project, recommendations will be made about how it could be followed up.

The questions at the outset of this project are:
- Does the neighbourhood an Airbnb is in correlate with its price?
- Has the number of Airbnbs in Edinburgh, their price, or availability changed post-Covid compared to pre-Covid?
- How well can Edinburgh Airbnb prices be predicted from InsideAirbnb's data alone?
